# 🌦️ Weather Forecasting ELT Pipeline

This project implements a **modular, scalable end-to-end ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** pipeline for **weather forecasting** using **Google Colab Python** and **Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery)**. It automates the process of collecting, storing, transforming, and modeling weather data to predict **hourly temperatures** in **Siegburg, Germany**.

The weather forecasting is at this stage in a simplified form to represent the function of the pipeline. In future, there may be a deeper focus on more complex machine learning models, but for now, it serves the purpose of demonstrating a **reproducible data engineering workflow**.  
Data is sourced from the **[Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/)** and processed into a structured format to support **machine learning-based forecasting**. The pipeline is built for experimentation and can be scaled with additional features like orchestration or containerization.

---

## Project Overview

The pipeline performs the following high-level steps:

1. **Extract** historical and current weather data via the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/).
2. **Load** this data into **Google BigQuery**, partitioned by year.
3. **Transform** and prepare the data through feature engineering.
4. **Predict** hourly temperatures using a **Random Forest** regression model.
5. **Store** the predictions back to BigQuery.

---

## Orchestration

The pipeline is orchestrated using **Prefect 3.5**, which allows each step to be defined as a **@task** and combined into a **flow**. Prefect manages **task dependencies, execution order, and monitoring**, ensuring that:

- Extraction occurs before loading into BigQuery.
- Transformation only runs once the required data is available.
- Machine learning training and predictions are executed after data preparation.
- Predictions are safely loaded into BigQuery.

This orchestration makes the pipeline **modular, reproducible, and maintainable**, while providing a clear overview of the workflow through DAG visualizations.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Google Colab**: Interactive environment for development, experimentation, and running Python code.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Provides the cloud infrastructure for this project, including **BigQuery** for storing and querying large weather datasets.
- **Prefect 3.5**: Orchestration framework for defining tasks and flows, managing dependencies, and visualizing the DAG.
- **Python Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn` for data processing and machine learning.
- **Graphviz**: Visualization library used to generate DAG diagrams of the pipeline tasks.

This combination of tools ensures an efficient, scalable, and cloud-native approach to building the weather forecasting pipeline.

For data retrieval, the project uses the **[Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/)**, which provides weather forecasts for different geographical regions.

## ELT Process

This project follows a structured **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** workflow, fully orchestrated with **Prefect 3.5**.  
Each step is implemented as a **Prefect @task**, managed within a central **flow**, allowing for dependency control, retry policies, and clear monitoring through DAG visualization.

### 1. Extract
- Fetches historical weather data (2017–2024) and current conditions using Open-Meteo’s REST API.
- Tasks handle both **historical** and **current** API calls separately for modularity.
- Stores raw JSON responses in memory and converts them to structured Pandas DataFrames.
- Automatically retries API calls if temporary connection errors occur (managed by Prefect).

### 2. Load
- Loads raw weather data into **Google BigQuery**, storing each year’s data in a separate table.
- Data loading is orchestrated so that BigQuery tables are created before loading occurs.
- Uses the `google-cloud-bigquery` Python client for seamless integration with GCP.

### 3. Transform
- Cleans and formats raw weather data into consistent schemas.
- Performs **feature engineering** to create columns such as:
  - `temperature`, `rel_humidity`, `precipitation`, `pressure`, `wind_speed`, `wind_direction`
- Merges historical and current data to prepare model-ready features.
- Executed only after successful loading, as enforced by Prefect task dependencies.

### 4. Model (Predict)
- Trains a **Random Forest Regressor** using historical October data.
- Generates hourly temperature predictions for the current period.
- The **ML Stage** sits at the center of the DAG, connecting data transformation with prediction output.
- Prefect ensures the model only trains after all required data transformations are complete.

### 5. Store
- Saves prediction results back to BigQuery for analytics or dashboarding.
- Acts as the final task in the flow, marking successful pipeline completion.

---

### Orchestration and Visualization
The entire ELT process is orchestrated through **Prefect 3.5**, ensuring tasks execute in the correct order and enabling recovery in case of failures.  
The dependency graph of the pipeline is visualized using **Graphviz**. The following DAG shows the Prefect-orchestrated workflow of the weather forecasting pipeline:

## Usage Guide

### 1. Set your Google Cloud Project ID
- Before running the notebook, open `elt_pipeline_weather.ipynb` and locate the configuration dictionary.
- Replace the `project_id` value with your own Google Cloud project ID and `dataset_month` to the current month, for example:

```python
config_data = {
    "project": {
        "project_id": "your-gcp-project-id",
        "dataset_historical": "elt_weather_dataset_historical_siegburg_2017_2024",
        "table_historical": "elt_weather_table_historical_siegburg_2017",
        "dataset_month": "elt_weather_dataset_siegburg_october_2025",
        "table_8h": "elt_weather_8h_table_{timestamp}",
        # ... other config values ...
    }
}
```

### 2. Run the Notebook
#### Execute all cells sequentially. This will:
- Fetch historical and current weather data
- Load data into BigQuery
- Run transformations and train a Random Forest model
- Store prediction results back into BigQuery

### 3. View Results
After completion, explore the predictions stored in your BigQuery dataset or extend the project with visualization tools.

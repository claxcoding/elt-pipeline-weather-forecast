It automates the process of collecting, storing, transforming, and modeling weather data to predict **hourly temperatures** in **Siegburg, Germany**.\n","\n","The weather forecasting is at this stage in a simplified form to represent the function of the pipeline. In future, there may be a deeper focus on more complex machine learning models, but for now, it serves the purpose of understanding the pipeline.\n","Data is sourced from the **[Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/)** and processed into a structured format to support **machine learning-based forecasting**. The pipeline is built for experimentation and can be scaled with additional features like orchestration or containerization.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Project Overview\n","\n","The pipeline performs the following high-level steps:\n","\n","1. **Extract** historical and current weather data via the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/).\n","2. **Load** this data into **Google BigQuery**, partitioned by year.\n","3. **Transform** and prepare the data through feature engineering.\n","4. **Predict** hourly temperatures using a **Random Forest** regression model.\n","5. **Store** the predictions back to BigQuery.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Tools and Technologies Used\n","\n","- **Google Colab**: Interactive environment for development, experimentation, and running Python code.\n","- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Provides the cloud infrastructure for this project, including **BigQuery** for storing and querying large weather datasets.\n","\n","\n","This combination of tools ensures an efficient, scalable, and cloud-native approach to building the weather forecasting pipeline.\n","\n","For data retrieval, the project uses the **[Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/)**, which provides weather forecasts for different geographical regions.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Attribution for Weather Data\n","\n","This project uses weather data provided by [Open-Meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com), which is offered under the [Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.\n","\n","You are free to copy, redistribute, and adapt the data, but please ensure proper attribution:\n","\n","- **Credit**: \"Weather data by Open-Meteo.com\"\n","- **Link**: [Open-Meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com)\n","- **Changes**: If you make changes to the data, you must indicate that modifications were made.\n","\n","For more information, refer to the [Open-Meteo Terms of Service](https://open-meteo.com/en/terms).\n","\n","**Example attribution (HTML for display in web or applications):**\n","```html\n","<a href=\"https://open-meteo.com/\">\n","\tWeather data by Open-Meteo.com\n","</a>\n","```\n","---\n","\n","## Project Structure\n","\n","```text\n","weather-forecasting-elt/\n","├── elt_pipeline_weather.ipynb      # Main notebook runner\n","├── gcp_utils/                      # Utilities for Google Cloud (BigQuery)\n","│   ├── create_dataset.py\n","│   ├── create_table.py\n","│   └── manage_gcp.py\n","├── weather_pipeline/               # ELT and ML logic\n","│   ├── Dockerfile\n","│   ├── fetch_utils.py\n","│   ├── load.py\n","│   ├── load_config.py\n","│   ├── main.py\n","│   ├── predictor_utils.py\n","│   ├── query_utils.py\n","│   ├── transform_utils.py\n","│   ├── visualization_utils.py\n","├── config.yaml                     # Central configuration file\n","├── requirements.txt                # Required packages\n","└── README.md                       # This file\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ELT Process\n","\n","### 1.

Transform\n","- Cleans and formats the raw data.\n","- Feature engineering includes:\n","  - `temperature`, `rel_humidity`, `precipitation`, `pressure`, `wind_speed`, `wind_direction`\n","- Combines historical data across multiple years (e.g., for October only).\n","- Prepares the data for machine learning.\n","\n","### 4. Model (Predict)\n","- Trains a **Random Forest Regressor** using historical October data.\n","- Predicts hourly temperatures.\n","- Evaluates and optionally visualizes prediction results.\n","\n","### 5. Store\n","- Saves prediction results back to BigQuery for analytics or dashboarding.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Usage Guide\n","\n","### 1. Set your Google Cloud Project ID\n","- Before running the notebook, open `elt_pipeline_weather.ipynb` and locate the configuration dictionary.\n","- Replace the `project_id` value with your own Google Cloud project ID and `dataset_month` to the current month, for example:\n","\n","```python\n","config_data = {\n","    \"project\": {\n","        \"project_id\": \"your-gcp-project-id\",\n","        \"dataset_historical\": \"elt_weather_dataset_historical_siegburg_2017_2024\",\n","        \"table_historical\": \"elt_weather_table_historical_siegburg_2017\",\n","        \"dataset_month\": \"elt_weather_dataset_siegburg_october_2025\",\n","        \"table_8h\": \"elt_weather_8h_table_{timestamp}\",\n","        # ... other config values ...\n","    }\n","}\n","```\n","\n","### 2.
